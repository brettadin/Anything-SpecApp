# For Future AI Agents

## Start Here
1. Read `/docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` to understand the mission
2. Review `/docs/FEATURES_FROM_V2.md` for what we're building
3. Check `/docs/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` for recent progress
4. Reference spectra-app-v2 repo for scientific accuracy

## Important Context
- This is a semester-long senior project
- Target users: students learning spectroscopy
- Must handle real astronomical data (JWST, MAST archives)
- Previous desktop versions exist — we're rebuilding as web app

## Key Technical Constraints
- Anything platform (React + JavaScript, not Python)
- No external packages except those listed in system
- Must maintain provenance tracking (lesson from v2)
