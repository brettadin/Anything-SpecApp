# Features to Port from spectra-app-v2

Based on https://github.com/brettadin/spectra-app-v2

## Must-Have (Core Workflow)
- [ ] Upload spectral data (CSV, ASCII, FITS)
- [ ] Plot multiple spectra
- [ ] Overlay reference lines from NIST
- [ ] Basic math operations (difference, ratio)
- [ ] Export with provenance

## Important (Research Grade)
- [ ] Unit conversion (nm/Å/µm/cm⁻¹)
- [ ] Provenance tracking
- [ ] MAST archive integration (JWST/HST)
- [ ] Annotations

## Nice to Have (Advanced)
- [ ] Gaussian fitting
- [ ] Peak detection
- [ ] IR functional groups
- [ ] Savitzky-Golay smoothing
